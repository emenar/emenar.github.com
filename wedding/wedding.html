<a href="people/index.html#Rebecca_Shen">Rebecca Yin-Shi Shen</a> and <a href="people/index.html#Mark_Fussell">Mark Lewis Fussell</a> were married on July Second, Nineteen hundred and ninety nine.
This was the culmination of fifteen years together (we are a bit cautious about these things), but
the wedding did occur in the same millenium as when we first met.

<P>The <a href="California.html">ceremony and main reception</a> were held at Kohl Mansion in Burlingame California in July.
A <a href="Pennsylvania.html">second reception</a> was held in Philadelphia in August.
Finally, Mark and Rebecca <a href="Taiwan.html">went to Taiwan</a> in October to meet the rest of Rebecca's family.
All counted, more than a <a href="people/index.html">hundred people</a> attended the ceremony or one of the receptions.
Only three of us were at all locations.
