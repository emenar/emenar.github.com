<BLOCKQuote><I>
Rebecca, please join me in life as my partner, my lover, my friend and my wife.
I cherish the relationship that we have found together and wish to make it last for an eternity.
I promise to continually discover who you are and help you to fulfill your needs, your goals, and your
dreams. I also promise to reveal myself to you, so you can see into my heart and assist me with my

I will always stand beside you with an open heart as we journey through life together.

<H2>Reception</H2>
The reception was also at Kohl Mansion, both outside on the patio and inside for a buffet dinner.
The dining featured a fabulous wine selection <FONT size="-1"><a href="wineList.pdf">(PDF)</a></font> provided by <a href="people/index.html#Beatrice_Lam">Beatrice Lam</a> and <a href="people/index.html#Luke_Manley">Luke Manley</a>, and a cornucopia of cheeses to go with it.
The dinner menu <FONT size="-1"><a href="menu.pdf">(PDF)</a></font> included: <a href="pictures/California_5.html#Wines">Wine</a>,
<a href="pictures/California_13.html#Say_Cheese_(Howard)">Appetizers and Cheese</a>,
<A href="pictures/California_6.html#Ed_Feasting" alt="Ed Feasting">Pasta, Vegetables, Chicken, and Roast Tenderloin</a>,
<a href="pictures/California_6.html#Mark's_Just_Desserts">Fruit and Ice Cream for Dessert</a>, and
<a href="pictures/California_14.html#Hungry_Tom">Cake</a> (which seems to have replaced the after-dinner mint).

<H3>Toasts</H3>
<IMG src="pictures/Wedding_B22_v1.jpg" alt="Taymin Toast" align=right hspace=10 width=288 height=160>
<P>During dinner Beatrice Lam gave the first toast and would soon follow that by encouraging others (<a href="pictures/California_7.html#Hod's_Toast">Hod</a>, <a href="people/people.html#Shang_Lee">Shang</a>, <a href="people/people.html#Patrick_Cotter">Patrick</a>, <a href="people/people.html#Larry_Allen">Larry</a>)
to go back in time to (sometimes) even before Mark and Rebecca had even met.

<P><a href="people/index.html#Taymin_Liu">Taymin Liu</a> (Rebecca's third Shen aunt) gave a very nice and very appreciated
toast welcoming Mark into the highly discriminating Shen family.


<P>Mark welcomed everyone to the celebration, was honored to be able to join Rebecca's families, and thanked those people (especially Bea and Geoffrey) that made the day possible.  This was followed by a toast to the most special group he knows <font size=-1><a href="markToast.pdf">(PDF)</a></font>.


<H3>Games and Dancing</H3>
On every dining table there were wrapped boxes,
and it took just a few seconds for the question
"What are the wrapped boxes for?" to arise.
There were also nine Beannie Babies on Rebecca and Mark's table.

<H4>The seek out new life forms game</H4>
<IMG src="pictures/Wedding_B63_v1.jpg" alt="Phoenix, Faye, and first child" align=right hspace=10 width=200 height=161>
The wrapped boxes were presents to the guests, and within each wrapping was either a Lego or a 3-D puzzle.
There were thirty different presents, but there were also three of each kind randomly dispersed throughout the room.
The task of the game was
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To find the owners of the two matching gifts and exchange among all three of you:
<UL>
<LI>Who each of you are
<LI>Where you are from
<LI>How you are related to Rebecca and myself
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The first three sets of three to correctly answer the above questions won the Beannie Babies.
Although this started out pretty quietly as people searched out and discovered their match, it soon swelled
into ninety people trying to get their Beannie Babies.
Whether people won a Beannie Baby or not, they could still build their <a href="pictures/California_8.html#Jason_and_Joe_constructing">Lego or Puzzle</a>.
We hope people enjoyed the game (it was the one of the few things it would have been fun to get on videotape).

<H4>Dancing</H4>
<IMG align=right src="pictures/Wedding_B57_v1.jpg" alt="Dancing and Smooching (Anne and Carl, Christy and Hod, Mark and Rebecca)" hspace=10 width=162 height=159>
Finally, Mark and Rebecca enjoyed their first dance as Husband and Wife.
This was followed by some <a href="pictures/California_15.html#Salsa:_Mark_and_Julie,_Rebecca_and_Rob">Salsa</a> and a little
<a href="pictures/California_15.html#Fast_and_Slow:_Anne_and_Howard,_Hod_and_Christy">Jitterbugging</a>.

<H2>Farewells</H2>
We hope everyone enjoyed the celebration and that all of our futures together will be even happier than our past.
